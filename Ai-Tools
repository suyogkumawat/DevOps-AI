Qodo (formerly Codium) is an agentic code integrity platform for reviewing, testing, and 
writing code, integrating AI across development workflows to strengthen code quality at every stage. 
Our agents are powered by a core platform that provides deep context awareness, 
enabling AI to understand the specific best practices of a codebaseâ€”and solve complex coding challenges more effectively.
